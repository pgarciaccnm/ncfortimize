The purpose of this project is to prove my skills and experience as an SF developer.

## Part 1: Understanding the Business Model

<strong>National Commercial business</strong>
NC manages and leasing properties.

Rep manages many Properties.<br>
Each property has many Units.<br>
The Rep leases the Units based on the Unit day cost.<br>
The commission earned by Rep is based on Graduated Commission model.<br>
The GC is associated with a period of time (year), Property Goal Amounts and has many tiers which define to the Rep performance.<br>
The Property Goal Amount is the goal must be reached by Rep in the period of GC.<br>
